# Branding guidelines

## Conditions of Use

These branding assets for use within the PixelPerfectEngine Project, and shall not be used to do the following:

1) Sell any products or be used as a statement of endorsement in promotional material of unrelated products.
2) Be used in a way that could tarnish the image of the project (e.g. breaking our code of conduct).
3) Sell the branding resources themselves.

## Current officially recognized branding materials

### The chip logo

![PixelPerfectEngine Logo large](branding/pixelperfectengine%20logo%20512.png) ![PixelPerfectEngine Logo small](branding/pixelperfectengine%20logo.png)

The chip logo and any of it's variants (an older less detailed variant, and variants with version numbers exist).

Created by ZILtoid1991.

### Things that are not recognized as branding materials:

* Icons and other graphical assets made specifically for the engine and its tools. They're under the same Boost License as the engine, and can be used in other projects.
* Other assets used in testing of the engine. See their own license and/or creators on information about use of theirs.
* Any non-officially recognized mascots.

## Examples of things that are allowed

* Using any of the branding materials or their variants in splash screens in games (or any other software) that are made with the engine and does not negatively reflect on the project as a whole.
* Using the logo in tutorials covering the engine (books, videos, etc.).
* Using the logo in advertisements of games (or any other software) that are made with the engine and does not negatively reflect on the project as a whole.

## Examples of things that are not allowed

* Using it on your application that is entirely unrelated to and/or does not make use of the engine.
* Using it for promotional material for a game written with an other engine.
* Making a fork of the project, calling it "PixelPerfectEngine" and using the same resources.
* Using it in a game featuring elements that could negatively reflect on the project itself.
* Selling PixelPerfectEngine branding assets as NFTs or selling unofficial merchandise with our branding resources on them.

## Stance on Erotic Games

While the PixelPerfectEngine project in itself has nothing against games of this nature as long as they don't feature the likeness (or fictionalized version) of real people not consenting to be featured, we do reserve the right to not provide support to developers of games which we find to be in bad taste.

## Stance on Cryptocurrencies and NFTs

Due to recent activities of secular-washing groups like Collective Shout, as well as openly religious fundamentalist groups like Exodus Cry, the cryptocurrency guidelines are as of the following:
* Games being able to be purchased with cryptocurrencies are allowed within branding guidelines.
* Games that promote the gambling and/or speculation of cryptocurrencies are not allowed, and branding material must be removed, no technical help will be provided.
* Games that feature NFT content, copy protection, etc. are not allowed, and branding material must be removed, no technical help will be provided.

Donations in cryptocurrency are still not accepted as of now.

## Stance on gambling

Games featuring real currency gambling cannot use branding materials and technical help from our team.

Games featuring gatcha mechanics, lootboxes, etc. can feature the branding materials as long as refunds for microtransactions are provided up to 2 weeks, or 2 months if the player is under 18 or a legal minor in some other way.

## Stance on AI generated assets

We reserve the right to not provide support and/or request a branding removal from projects that:
* can be proven to use assets generated by machine learning algorithms fed with data their original creators did not consent (with the creators having the chance of proving themselves innocent),
* their creators have a toxic attitude towards artists not willing to embrace AI (e.g. gloat about them losing their jobs) on public platforms.

The project will make sure any asset used for testing purposes are either made free to use, is public domain, or was specifically made for the game engine/a test game.
