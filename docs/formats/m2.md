# The M2 format and the Music Declaration Language

## Background and rationale behind creating the M2/MDL formats

* There's no known MIDI 2.0 file formats.
* Most other music command file formats also lack extensions for creating adaptive soundtracks.

## General guidelines

* Make the format easy to process by the sequencer.
* Make it based on RIFF and similar data serialization formats.
* Give it branching capabilities for adaptive soundtracks.

# Version history

Preimplementation versions included a human-readable version based on SDLang.

# Header format

# Command list

## null command

Bytecode layout:

```
[00]{00|00|00}
```

Doesn't do anything. In bytecode, the word must be set to all zeroes

## wait command

SDL layout:

Bytecode layout:

```
[01]{24 bits of time value}
```
or
```
[02]{24 most significant bits of time value}{32 least significant bits of time value}
```

Makes the sequencer wait between chains of commands by the given amount. Type of amount is set by the header.

This command have two different bytecodes in case a single 24 bit wait time isn't enough in certain cases.

## emit command

Bytecode layout:

```
[03]{Amount: 8 bits}{Device: 16 bits}
```

Emits a given amount of words of MIDI data to the targeted device. If more needed, then more must be chained together. One command ideally should target a single device. Device 65535 is the sequencer, and can be used for things like setting 

## Conditional jump command

Bytecode layout:
```
[04]{Amount of conditions: 24 bits}
{jump amount: 32 bits signed integer}
Conditions:
{Condition code: 8 bits}{Flags: 4 bits}{Misc code: 6 bits}{Value ID: 14 bits}
{Value to be checked against: 32 bits}
```

If the conditions are not met, then the sequencer will skip forward the given amount of words. If amount of conditions are zero, it'll always jump.

### Condition codes

* `0x00` = Equals within Misc
* `0x01` = Greater or equal 
* `0x02` = Greater than
* `0x03` = Less or equal
* `0x04` = Less than
* `0x05` = Not equal within Misc
* `0x06` = Increment by Misc2 while less than.
* `0x07` = Decrement by Misc2 while greater than.
* `0x08` = Previous condition was false.

### Flags

* Bit 0: If set, next condition will be ANDed to the rest, OR-ed otherwise.
* Bit 1: Toggles AND and OR into NAND and XOR respectively.
* Bit 2: Priority flag, if high this and the next condition will have a higher priority in evaluation. Works as an analogue to brackets.
