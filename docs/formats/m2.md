# The M2 format and the Music Declaration Language

## Background and rationale behind creating the M2/MDL formats

* There's no known MIDI 2.0 file formats.
* Most other music command file formats also lack extensions for creating adaptive soundtracks.

## General guidelines

* Make both a human-readable version, and a binary (byte-code) one too.
* For the human-readable version, use either the original SDL-parser, or a modified version of it.
* Make things like note numbers and time durations to be able to be inputted in easy to understand way.
* The binary version should be easy to process to the sequecer.
* Make some branching capabilities to aid the composition of adaptive music.

# Command legends and macros

## General legends

* `[Mandatory parameter](Type)`: This is a mandatory parameter of the given command. Type must match.
* `[Mandatory parameter](Type1)/(Type2)`: This mandatory parameter can have multiple types. Note that strings have their own subtypes too.
* `{Optional attribute}(Type)`: Sometimes commands will have optional parameters. They're named, and can have multiple type options on occassion.

## Note duration macros

Musical rhythm-based times are supported by the MDL format, as string macros.

* Whole notes are `w`, half are `h`, quarter are `q`, and eigth are `e`.
* Furhter subdivisions can be achieved with stacking other divisions before any eigth note, `he` is a sixteenth note, `hee` is a 128th note, etc.
* Dotter rhythms are done with adding one or more `d` to the notes.
* Numbers written after the notes create "triplets", like `he3`.
* These must be added with the plus symbol, like `w+q`or `q+hedd`.

## Note macros

Notes can be inputted in the following fashion:

`C-5`, `D#0`

Multiple notes can be stringed together by putting space between them, for chords:

`C-5 E-5 G-5`
