## Donation

Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ShapeshiftingLizard

The only hardware donation I might accept currently is some AArch64-based Windows PC, so I could also target that platform. 32 bit ARM devices are not considered as of now due to limited capacity. As of now, I cannot spend time on the ever changing APIs of Apple

You can also donate your testing time, knowledge, and coding directly to the engine.

# Getting started

## Requirements

The engine does not require a lot of computational power, however it requires:

* A 128 bit vector unit.
* OpenGL 3.3 or OpenGL ES 3.0 graphics.
* At least 100MB free system memory.
* An audio device (low latency devices recommended).
* Some form of input device.

Also the engine is no longer being tested for 32 bit processors, contact me if you really need 32 bit support.

To build the engine, you'll need the LLVM D compiler (LDC), due to its stellar performance and better vector support. DMD no longer supported.

## Setting up developer environment and recommended toolchain

First, you'll need the LDC compiler. You can download it from the following link:

https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc

It works on Windows, Linux, X86-64, AArch64, which are the platforms currently capable of running the engine. It'll also come with dub, which is one of the best build tools/package managers ever created.

As a development environment I recommend using VSCode or one of its community versions. There's a D extension by WebFreak, you'll need to install that. Optionally, you might want to install a C++ plugin with a debugger. Under Windows, you'll unfortuantely be needing Visual Studio itself for its linker and libraries.

Speaking of debuggers, under Linux, I have a lot of good luck with GDB. LLDB probably works too. Windows, on the other hand, is way more complicated. Since the engine now primarily targets 64 bit CPUs, our choice of debuggers are limited. VS and WinDBG works for sure, but really doesn't like D structs and pointers when the target is 64 bits. RemedyBG on the other hand, is a paid solution, however for most things, works better than any of Microsoft's own debuggers. Except break on exceptions, but it can be worked around by putting breakpoints into the constructors of the exceptions.

### Setting up Kate

As an alternative to VSCode, Kate is recommended. You'll need to install serve-d (just clone the repository, compile it with dub, then move the execuable into a folder added to your path), then it's ready to go.

## Paths

By default, the engine stores all executables in a `./bin-[CPUarch]-[OS]` subfolder, such as `./bin-x86_64-windows`. The engine will work without modification if the executables from that folder are moved to the root as long as it can detect the presence of the `./system` folder as long as paths are processed first with the `resolvePath()` function.

Path symbols are treated similar to the operating system's, and both starts and ends with a `%` symbol, e.g. `%SHADERS%`. The `%` symbol can be escaped by placing two of them side-by-side. Custom path symbols can be created with the line `pathSymbols["SYMBOLNAME"] = pathRoot ~ "/yourpath/";`. Path symbols also can used for other purposes, like localization settings. Can be escaped, e.g. `%%APPDATA%%` to access system paths, but not recommended due to potential portability issues.

### More important path symbols and folders.

 * `%PATH%`: points to the root where the current instance of the game engine resides. Might not be present of smartphones, consoles, etc.
 * `%EXEC%`: points to the folder of the current binary, could be either equal to `%PATH%`, or `%PATH%/bin-[CPUarch]-[OS]`.
 * `%SYSTEM%`: contains system assets in `%PATH%/system/`, like default configuration, default bindings, etc.
 * `%SHADERS%`: contains shaders in `%PATH%/shaders/`.
 * `%SHDRVER%`: contains the currently set shader version, intended to be used like `%SHADER%/final_%SHDRVER%.frag`.
 * `%LOCAL%`: contains localization files.
 * `%CURRLOCAL%`: contains the current localizaton setting, intended to be used like `%LOCAL%/texts_%CURRLOCAL%.xml`.

## Garbage collection

In most circumstances, the tracing garbage collector shouldn't interfere too much with performance, as in most usecases, it only takes a few miliseconds to run, and the audio is running on a separate thread. However refresh rates higher than 60-75 Hz will pose a challenge, and more memory use will mean longer tracing times.

By version 1.0, even more things will avoid the GC, so it can be optionally disabled, and reference counting will be added to the engine as an option. Even later versions might even move to an alternative runtime.

## Working with templates

In the engine's root folder, there's a folder for application templates. It is recommended to copy the code out from them and into your initial source file, especially if you're unfamiliar with the many subsystems of the engine. You can modify them to fit your needs later on.

# Tile maps and tile layers

Since Galaga, a lot of game systems were built upon tilemapping engines, where each element acted like a highly modifiable graphics character. This enabled a building block system, that is easy to use and understand.

## PPE tile format

### Tilemap 

The tilemap is a 2D array, that consists of 32 bit data chunks with the following format:

```
| Byte 3 | Byte 2 | Byte 1 | Byte 0 |
|76543210|76543210|76543210|76543210|
|ZRVHPPPP|PPPPPPPP|SSSSSSSS|SSSSSSSS|
```

Or:

* 16 bits of tile selector, 0xFF_FF equals with empty tile. (S)
* * 12 bits of palette selector. (P)
* 1 bit for horizontal mirroring. (H)
* 1 bit for vertical mirroring. (V)
* 1 bit for X-Y axis rotate enable, using alongside of the mirroring flags, it enables 90 and 270ยบ rotation among others. Will cause incorrect behavior with non 1:1 ratio tiles. (R)
* 1 bit for priority. If tile layer is linked with another one, they will be sharing tilemap and image information data. All of the tiles will be displayed on the primary tilelayer, unless this one is the to high, then it is sent to the secondary layer. (Z)
 
Examples:

* `0x0000_FFFF` is a transparent tile. The other half of the tile data will be ignored.
* `0x0004_0101` is a tile of ID `0101` using palette `04`, with priority value set to 0, and no mirroring or rotation.
* `0xD000_002c` is a tile of ID `002c` using palette `00`, with priority value set to 1, with horizontal mirroring and rotation.

#### Extensions

Tilemap extensions are provided for both graphics and logic, see `format/mapdata.md` for more information on the subject.

By general, graphics extensions are used to add shadow/highlight effects to the tiles and other objects

### Tilesheets

(NOTE TO SELF: insert example tilesheet here)



# Sprites

Sprites are fully independently movable and transformable objects on the screen.

# Colllisions

# Audio

# Scripting

The game engine is using WASM (WebAssembly - please note that despite its name, applications built with the game engine are not "Electron applications running in a browser", nor are necessarily ready for web export) for scripting, by using the wasmtime library, for multi-language compatibility and a lightweight scripting engine. There will be a C/C++ and a D binding soon.

**Differences from regular WASM:**

* No HTML functionality. However engine functionality for drawing and text formatting (ETML) are exposed instead.
* No WebGL or similar graphics API. Any low-level meddling with the graphics API should be done in low-level code.
* Same with any other web API.
* No built-in browser in the game engine.
* No Javascript is used on the engine side, `__externref_t` and `JSObj` are now refer to D classes on the backend instead.
* WASI is not used, instead it uses the engine's own logging system for the same purpose.
* The engine's API is being exposed instead.
* Custom functionality API can be exposed using appropriate wasmtime-d functions.

**Best practices:**

* WASM can still hurt performance, thus time-critical elements (physics, graphics, audio, etc.) should be handled low-level.
* Generally, scripts should be scripts and not general game logic, but target application might override this rule (e.g. heavy modding support).
